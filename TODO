* add test for compute_ious
* Unfuck docs: use material for mkdocs

* Start with detections: some MVP with simple inputs, then modularize it out


---

Detections:
* add frame getter
  * also `__in__` or whatever it is (contains?)
* Fix prec recall curve - now we can have nones for both, instead of just returning a single none

Add tests:
  * For summary:
    * simple unit tests that test averaging of different thresholds and classes 
  * example
    * for the example - try with the two different IoU thresholds
  * add tests for summary - maybe here less "mini-integration" tests
  * Add integration test - just check AP, more or less ok value


---

* for tracks hard code field names (do not use common global vars) for reading/writing formats
* Add class names to tracks - maybe change the class list arg to dict?
