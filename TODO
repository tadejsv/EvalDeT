* add test for compute_ious
* Unfuck docs: use material for mkdocs

* Start with detections: some MVP with simple inputs, then modularize it out


----

* add error if gts empty
* test it:
  * examples with no gts/detections [should return reasonable values]
  * some toy examples that can be manually calculated - play with iou threshold and area range a bit
* Finally, make it a numba function, see that all works. try with parallel? if parallel does not work/make sense, try maybe to simplify accumulation
