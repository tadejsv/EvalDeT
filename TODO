* add test for compute_ious
* Unfuck docs: use material for mkdocs

* Start with detections: some MVP with simple inputs, then modularize it out


---

Detections:
* Start with COCO format
* make sure to capture image and class names (to later match)

---

* for tracks hard code field names (do not use common global vars) for reading/writing formats
* Add class names to tracks - maybe change the class list arg to dict?
